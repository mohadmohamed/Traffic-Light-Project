# Traffic Light Project

 That was the final project for the summer training of my college of my 1st year as a communication and computer engineer, where I used MicroController PIC16f877A
 for impleminting the traffic lights of 2 ways: south and west.

 Each road has it's own 7seg timer and it's own traffic light.

 I first used Proteus to implement the circuit then I used MikroC for writing the code through which the MicroController will operate with.
